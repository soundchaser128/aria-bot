                    A \"yes\" or \"yes mistress\" should have been easy, but you had to get mouthy. \
                    So your new name is **{slave_name}** and you'll see what that means if you don't improve your attitude.",

                                  I've decided to name you **{slave_name}** because you're almost getting the idea but seem a little slow."
